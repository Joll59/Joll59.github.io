#### Drafting and focusing your interview pitch!
- Can it be google hangout instead of Skype?
- 2/11 -2/12 mock interview 30 minutes
- Solely HR and cultural based questions
	- Tell me about yourself!
	- Why do you want to be a dev?
	- What are you looking for in a job?
	- Walk me through your career history!

- 30 second elevator pitch!
	- It's focused on you in a manner that matters to the situation!
	- Short summary before FlatIron, why you made the switch, what you are currently 	  working on?
		- Do not ask "what do you want to know?"
		- Do not share personal stories.  
		- Do not Ramble.(Focused and On Point)
		- Do not emphasize how junior you are and how much you need to learn.
		- Instead emphasize your eagerness to learn, avoid keywords indicating you are junior!
- Find your whys?
	- Why did you start coding? Loved solving problems, and it never about the individual problems, its what those problems lead to. I went into research with the notion of helping to solve big problems.     
	- why did you leave your previous job?
	- why do you want to continue?

- Frame what you are looking for, for your interviewer.
- You always want to have questions for the interviewer.(Company focused?)(what current projects are you focused on?)
- Business casual attire!
